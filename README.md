Things Are Never So Bad That They Can't Get Worse: Inside the Collapse of Venezuela by William Neuman Book Review

Name: M. K. Danielsson
Rating: 3.0 out of 5 stars
Title: Great insights on Venezuela, but trips itself up with absurd takes on US politics.
Date: Reviewed in the United States on December 24, 2022
Review: The first 90% of the book is great, but the last 30 pages jumps the shark with laughable claims about U.S. politics. The author begins by seriously claiming that the terminal stage of Venezuela - with virtually zero public services, complete societal breakdown and widespread starvation - is the "dream goal" of Republicans. Really. Page 269: "Republicans in the U.S. considered Maduro their enemy. They should have been applauding him. He was a fellow traveler."

The final chapter continues in the same vein, where the author reveals himself to be afflicted by severe Trump Derangement Syndrome. I did not vote for either Trump or Hillary since they're both despicable human beings; I have no dog in this fight. But I find it incredibly tedious to hear the same absurd claims about the Bad Orange Man that have been trotted out daily for the past seven (!) years. It's just such a disappointing end to an otherwise 5-star book.

Title: how an oil rich country was felled by notably the collision of competing ideologies
Date: Reviewed in the United States on July 31, 2022
Review: William Neuman‚Äôs book Things Are Never So Bad They Can‚Äôt Get Worse reads like a novel but is in fact non fiction. The stories told underline the failure of any authority in Venezuela to do its job amid political interference and corruption, and the need of the populace to survive monumental incompetence. There are heroic individuals struggling to manage institutions like power plants constantly being undermined by other forces. And the impact on the poor and working class citizenry is so evident, yet they cling to ideological beliefs and slogans that paper over the ineptitude of the government and other players. Neumann spent a lot of time in South America professionally as bureau chief for the NYTimes and his contacts deliver withering observations on the Chavez regime especially after Chavez is followed by less skillful officials. At some point the very left and the very right moved so far from the center that they meet each other and share some common traits and experiences. Fascinating look at a society that had such potential and unfortunately squandered it all for politics.

Title: Great Insights into Venezuelan Crisis (coming from a Venezuelan)
Date: Reviewed in the United States on April 18, 2022
Review: I am really happy to see a book that covers the situation in a balanced way and covers the whole spectrum of society. As someone who grew up in Venezuela, the situation was so polarized that you never got the chance to understand the other side. It was always seen as "us vs them" and nobody listened to each other. This book clearly states this political division and tries to cover the point of view of the very poor, the rich, the opposition, chavismo, among many others. Not only that, it covers the impact on the economy and society from historical and current point of view.s

With all the misinformation going around in the country, it is refreshing to see a well-written book that fact checks every story and the numbers associated with it. I felt I got "behind-the-scene" information from events I saw live on TV, Twitter or even Whatsapp messages. I learned new things about the country I hold dearly and got sad about the current state of it. Coincidentally, I left Venezuela in 2012 when the author just arrived. So it was a way for me to follow someone who lived the years in Venezuela when I wasn't.

Overall, a fun and informative read that I will share with friends, family, and anybody that asks me why Venezuela is in a crisis! Thank you to the author for all the hard work in getting this book into reality.

Title: Good book, bad politics
Date: Reviewed in the United States on September 7, 2022
Review: The author clearly knows Venezuela but comically points the finger a handful of times towards the right wing of American politics. It‚Äôs quite laughable. As long as you can get over the authors left wing politics (he was a former New York Times writer) then this is quite a good book about Venezuela.

Title: Journey to Understanding
Date: Reviewed in the United States on November 5, 2022
Review: Readers of this book will be watching over the narrator's shoulder as he encounters the chaotic, irrational, difficult lives of ordinary everyday Venezuelans struggling to cope with out-of-control political, economic, and social disintegration. What readers gain from this experience is a broad understanding of the forces driving a lot of the southern migration to the US, and a reason why the US remains a beacon of hope for desperate and intelligent people all over the world.

Title: Absorbing book
Date: Reviewed in the United States on September 17, 2022
Review: I learned a lot from this book and felt immersed in what has been happening in Venezuela. As I said, it is an immersive read, from the bottom up, looking at the experiences of average people for the most part. I thought the writer offered some real insights in why Venezuela has disintegrated and why it can‚Äôt break out of the downward spiral. And there quite a number of sentences that struck with great force. The last few pages were such a solid summation of the country‚Äôs condition.

Title: Venezuela collapse
Date: Reviewed in the United States on September 15, 2022
Review: This is an excellent book that describes the descent of Venezuela in to complete degradation. People are actually starving, minimal or no health care, and complete loss of human rights(except for the elites). The statement that things could always get worse is true actually anywhere you live and especially in Venezuela. If you really desire to know what has happened to Venezuela, read this book.
